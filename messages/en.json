        {
          "question": "Why is VGP compliance not included in the Starter plan?",
          "answer": "The Starter plan is designed for basic tracking only. VGP compliance requires advanced features (inspection scheduling, certificate management, DIRECCTE reporting) available from the Professional plan onwards. For French equipment rental companies, we strongly recommend the Professional plan."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the difference between monthly and annual billing?",
          "answer": "Annual billing offers a 15% discount compared to monthly payments. For example, the Professional plan costs €14,400/year with annual billing, versus €1,412/month with monthly billing (€16,944/year total)."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I change plans at any time?",
          "answer": "Yes, you can upgrade your plan at any time. Downgrades are possible at the end of your annual billing period. Contact our team to discuss your specific situation."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are extensions compatible with all plans?",
          "answer": "The Extra Assets Pack is available for all plans. Other extensions (predictive maintenance, ERP integrations, priority SLA) require the Professional plan or higher."
